# Service_Independence
In this example, the OrderService sends an HTTP GET request to the UserService using the RestTemplate. By minimizing dependencies and using well-defined APIs, you ensure that changes to the UserService won't impact the OrderService as long as the API contract remains consistent.

These Java code examples illustrate the principles of service independence in a microservices architecture. In a real-world scenario, you'd need to implement more advanced features such as error handling, security, service discovery, load balancing, and data consistency mechanisms.
